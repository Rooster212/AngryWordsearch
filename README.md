# AngryWordsearch
Wordsearch created for Android coursework at University.

We were tasked to create a wordsearch application, which gave us experience with AJAX requests and Java, as well as the Android development process.

Unfortunately we had to use Eclipse, as Android Studio was too new to create course content for.
